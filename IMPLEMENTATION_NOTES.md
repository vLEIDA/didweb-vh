idna, btc58, multihash (although not the hashes we might want to use), and jcs covered

However, there don't seem to be good libraries for W3C data-integrity-proofs or a multikey implementation on hex.pm.  Any implementation would probably need stuff like that.  I guess the python implementation just implements a partial data-integrity-proof https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh-py/blob/main/did\_webvh/core/proof.py
